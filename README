TODO:
    -> Develop a better way to generate subroutines in fortran from ShellScripts.
    -> Develop an interface to call subroutines in fortran from the command line.
    -> Develop a deallocate datatype subroutine
    OK Add valid_min and valid_max in netcdf datatypes
    -> Add check class error subroutine if not encounter number of class into map
    -> Fixes output format for zonalstatistics subroutines
    -> Develop function to check if exists _FillValue variable in the file. 
       If does not exist, the program must return the option for user to set _FillValue 
       or set automatically according to the data type defined.
    -> Create a subroutine to insert easily the FillValue within the variable of netcdf file.
